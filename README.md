<h4>Summary 
</h4>
______________________________________________________________________

Though our analysis we found the following to be true based on our data:

1) There are more Males than Females or Unknown genders who use the ride sharing service. This is seen in figure 1 
2) number of bikes is greatest in the mornings or late afternoon/evening. this is seen in figure 4 
3) more male subscribers use the service than customers. this is seen in figure 3 

Suggestions for future visualizations 

1) Trips by age group 
2) Trips and the costs of the trip
